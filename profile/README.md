# The movement for public AI

Public AI is first of all an idea: that AI is and can be a form of **public infrastructure** like highways, parks, libraries, water, electricity, and the Internet itself. The **movement for public AI**, or **Public AI** (capitalized), is a global movement committed to building public AI. It is not a single organization but a union of independent projects and contributors working toward a shared vision.

## What We Do

We coordinate around specific projects, including:

- **Public AI Inference Utility** – A pilot making public AI models more accessible and demonstrating real user demand for public AI.  
- **Airbus for AI** – A multilateral effort toward a public-private frontier-scale model.  
- **Public AI Libraries** – Drop-in AI makerspaces across public libraries.  
- **Benchmarks** – Educational resources on AI benchmarks and evaluations.
- **Swiss Public Inference Utility** - Working to grow Swiss options for AI.

## Get Involved

We welcome engineers, researchers, policymakers, designers, and community members. Explore repositories, open issues, or bring new projects aligned with the Public AI mission.

**Public AI is built by all of us.**
