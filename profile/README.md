# The movement for public AI

Public AI is first of all an idea: that AI is and can be a form of **public infrastructure** like highways, parks, libraries, water, electricity, and the Internet itself. The **movement for public AI**, or **Public AI** (capitalized), is a global movement committed to building public AI. It is not a single organization but a union of independent projects and contributors working toward a shared vision.

## What We Do

We coordinate around specific projects, including:

- **Public Inference** - the _Public AI Inference Utility_ is a pilot making public AI models more accessible and demonstrating real user demand for public AI. The _Swiss Public Inference Utility_ is a nation-level approach to this.
- **Public Frontier Model** - _Airbus for AI_ is a multilateral effort toward a public-private frontier-scale model.  
- **Public AI for Libraries** – Drop-in AI makerspaces across public libraries.  
- **Public benchmarks** – Educational resources on AI benchmarks and evaluations; platforms like _Weval_ for collaboratiev benchmarking.
- **Public coalition** - the _Public AI Network_ is a community of builders and advocates supporting one another in the movement towards more public AI.
- **Public data** - _Data flywheels_ for gathering usage data to improve public AI, and an _AI Commons_ of well-provenanced public knowledge for training and grounding AI systems.

## Get Involved

We welcome engineers, researchers, policymakers, designers, and community members. Explore repositories, open issues, or bring new projects aligned with the Public AI mission.

**Public AI is built by all of us.**
